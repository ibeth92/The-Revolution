<p align="center">“Recorded music permeates every aspect of our daily lives and legal access-based music services combined with illegal online file sharing services means that more or less every song is available everywhere, all the time. This access explosion transforms the way people use and relate to recorded music.”

## Background

![1-Intro](Images/1.png)

Project Description/Outline:

To begin, our team took the GTZAN Genre Collection Dataset found at www.kaggle.com which consists of 1,000 audio tracks each 30 seconds long to train our model. The dataset contains 10 genres, each represented by 100 tracks which are all 22050 Hz monophonic 16-bit audio files in .au format. We will use these files to train our model utilizing machine learning in order to classify dataset audio files and uploaded 30 second sample sets into the following genres: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, reggae, rock, metal and pop.

### Visualizations

The first visual is an interactive map which allows the user to explore data we found on WWII aerial bombing events that occurred between 1942 and 1945 within all theaters. This tells us a visual story of the major bombing events that took place during WWII and how these may have influenced the overall trajectory of the war. 

Our second visual is an interactive table chart that shows the detailed stats of the data we found including aircraft used to transport the bombs, weapons locations, etc. and gives the user the opportunity to see the war unfold in a chronological order, with the opportunity to select and interact with specific dates in history.
